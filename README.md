It provides a modern and efficient development setup with Vite, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The goal of this project is to offer a seamless integration of AI capabilities with web development tools for building powerful web applications.

## Features

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to your code, helping prevent bugs.
- **Vite**: A next-generation build tool that provides fast and modern development experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling your components quickly and efficiently.
- **Lucide React**: A collection of beautiful icons to integrate seamlessly into your application.
- **Claude AI API Integration**: Leverage the power of Claude AI for generating content, suggestions, or functionality within your web applications.
- **WebContainers**: An innovative technology to run the application directly in the browser, providing an instant cloud-based development environment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (your preferred package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsndz/olt.git
   cd olt
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run the following:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view your application.

### Building for Production

To build your application for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimized files will be output to the `dist` directory, ready to be deployed.

### Linting

To check and fix linting issues, use the following command:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally, run:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This will start a local server that serves your built application, allowing you to check it before deploying to production.
